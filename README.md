## this is just simple one afternoon practice with redux-saga


Just expamle and little "sandbox" with redux + saga
Main goal here was practice that and get hands dirty
Secondary goal is showcase of my folder structuring - syntax approach to potentional employer




overall impressions:

1. little bit complicated but still more readable than thunk
2. redux-saga docs are easy to follow, nicely written
3. I am new in redux / redux saga, definitelly super long setup to get something done
4. more straightforward than I expected
5. Gonna use this in e-commerce with firebase
